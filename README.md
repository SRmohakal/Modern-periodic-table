<b>Project Title: Interactive Periodic Table</b><br>
<b>Description</b><br>
*Develop an interactive and user-friendly application that serves as a modern periodic table. The
application will provide detailed information about each element, including its atomic number,
name, symbol, atomic mass, and type. Users can easily search for elements by their names or
symbols and obtain relevant information.*<br>
<b>Features:</b><br>
<b>Element Information</b><br>
*Display comprehensive information about each element, including atomic number, name, symbol,
atomic mass, and type. Allow users to navigate through different sections of the periodic table.*<br>
<b>Search Functionality</b><br>
*Implement a search feature that enables users to find elements by entering either the name or
symbol. Use case-insensitive comparison to enhance search accuracy.*<br>
<b>Detailed View</b><br>
*Provide a detailed view for each element, showcasing additional information, such as electron
configuration, discovery date, and common uses.*<br>
<b>Filtering and Sorting</b><br>
*Allow users to filter elements based on their types (metals, non-metals, metalloids, etc.). Implement
sorting options for organizing elements alphabetically, by atomic number, or by atomic mass.*<br>
<b>Dynamic Updates</b><br>
*Enable periodic updates to ensure the inclusion of new elements or any changes in known element
properties.*<br>
<b>Multi-Platform Support</b><br>
*Develop the application to be accessible across multiple platforms, including desktop and mobile
devices.*<br>
<b>Customization Options</b><br>
*Provide users with the ability to customize the display settings, such as theme colours, font size, and
arrangement of elements.*<br>
<b>Quiz/Game Feature</b><br>
*Include a quiz or game feature to engage users in a fun and interactive way, reinforcing their
knowledge of the periodic table.*<br>
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
*Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities by incorporating features like screen
reader compatibility and keyboard navigation. This interactive periodic table application not only
serves as a valuable resource for students and educators but also caters to anyone interested in
exploring and learning about the elements in a user-friendly and engaging manner.*<br>
